THE BOBS SCREENSAVER

1. WHAT IS IT?
A simple screensaver for Linux and UNIX which displays animated 'Bobs'


2. HOW TO USE BOBS
If Bobs compiles and installs successfully for you, then it should be
available from the gnome-screensaver-preferences program or available in the
KDE screensaver preferences. Xscreensaver is supported, but requires manual
installation.


3. FAQ

    * Which screensaver systems are supported?
    - Officially Gnome 2, KDE 4 and XScreensaver. Others might work but have
      not been tested.

    * The 'Bobs' don't show correctly, I just get coloured circles, squares or
      a black screen, why?
    - Your implementation of OpenGL is not at least version 1.5 or doesn't
      support point sprites.

    * I can't access the configuration or setup options, why?
    - You should be able to configure the screensaver if you're using
      XScreensaver.
    - Configuring the screensaver under KDE is only supported, if the
      XScreensaver configuration files are installed.
    - The Gnome screensaver system, does not support screensaver configuration.

    * I'm running KDE or Gnome and Bobs compiled and installed, but I can't
      find it in the screensaver list. Any ideas?
    - Some distributions replace Gnome's or KDE's native screensaver system
      with Xscreensaver. Try following install instructions for Xscreensaver
    - You may need to specify the correct install prefix with configure.
      Bobs is installed in /usr/local by default if no prefix is specified,
      which may be incorrect for your operating system.

    * Why does support for Xscreensaver need to be installed manually?
    - Xscreensaver does not appear to provide a mechanism to detect where its
      screensavers and configuration files should be installed and I haven't
      found a method which works safely and reliably across all supported
      operating systems.

    * Is KDE 3 supported?
    - Not officially. Bob's build system is not setup for KDE 3.
      However with some manual intervention you can probably get it working.

    * Where do I send bug reports?
    - See the AUTHORS file.

    * Where do I send patches/contributions?
    - See the AUTHORS file.
